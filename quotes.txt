Responsive is better than fast
ItвЂ™s not fully shipped until itвЂ™s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. 'Til your good is better and your better is best.
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star.
Set your goals high, and don't stop till you get there.
Тише едешь, дальше будешь
В деловом мире зеркало заднего вида всегда четче, чем лобовое стекло.
